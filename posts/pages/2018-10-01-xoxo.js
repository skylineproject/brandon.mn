        <Post title={'What XOXO 2018 taught me about running events.'}>
            <p>There’s this conference called <a href="https://xoxofest.com">XOXO</a>, and I got to attend this year. It’s one of those things that I’ve kept an eye on since before I was a software-y person. </p>

            <p>See, for the first four years XOXO occurred, I was a student. The conference occurred during the first week of the school year. That doesn’t really work out. Year five, they had a hiatus. Year six, I’m an employee at a place! How nice!</p>

            <p>During that same six-year timeframe, I got involved with this thing called <a href="http://javascriptmn.com">JavaScriptMN</a>. As you may have surmised, it’s a neat meetup for folks who are interested in JavaScript, and are in or near to Minnesota. Nowadays, I’m an organizer there.</p>

            <p>One of the things that drew me to XOXO, too, was its organizers. Andy and Andy had run the show essentially on their own (expanding the team along with the number of available tickets for their return). This year, I could see their approach up-close, and it was truly something special.</p>

            <p>There’s a lot tied up in running an event, though. After the conference ended, I took a moment to think through what I learned from this year’s XOXO, as a person who runs events.</p>

            <h3>how to talk about the event & logistics</h3>
            <p>Starting off each day of the conference, the Andys would walk us through some logistics. Opening remarks aren’t out of the ordinary, but I found the clarity and specificity crucial: when talking about the code of conduct, for example, it’s important to stress the seriousness and specificity with which it will be enforced. The event also provided these neat pins with one’s pronouns on them, and made establishing content warnings a priority. I’m familiar with CWs online (on Mastodon, in blog posts, and such), but hadn’t seen them used at an event before.</p>

            <p>While the Andys acknowledged there were situations where more comprehensive CWs could have been provided, it was really instructive for me to pay attention to how and when CWs were offered, and when real-time feedback indicated they should have been offered. These are all actions that take preparation, but are aimed at <u>making people more comfortable</u>. This can’t be ad-lib’d.</p>

            <h3>how to talk about yourselves</h3>
            <p>The ad-lib’d parts, though, can also be quite nice. I had always heard that the Andys’ banter was a fun part of the XOXO intermissions. They’re really kind folks, who are trying to build a community of other really kind folks, and that comes through in the conversation they have. They are – above all – really nice humans trying to make a really nice event for other really nice humans. They show gratitude to speakers, and genuine excitement toward upcoming events, and kindness toward attendees.</p>

            <p>On the Friday of the conference, a friend from out of the country and I were looking for an air-conditioned place to catch up. On the promise of hidden surprises at the event venue, we decided to explore the stadium. We ran into Andy McMillan, where he asked what our business was. “To find the surprise, like you said yesterday!” I cheerfully replied. “You aren’t really supposed to be here, but someone with more authority than I will tell you that,” he chuckled. I half-joked: “is this a misdirect?” “No, seriously,” he said. He could’ve freaked out, maybe many folks would. But that banter was pretty darned entertaining, and made me smile (and, yeah – we exited the building promptly).</p>

            <p>If you’ve ever been to a JSMN event I’ve hosted, you’ll know I can get <a href="https://youtu.be/R_cywFgnMM8?t=5m2s">a little wordy</a> <a href="[XSS Attacks and How to Prevent Them - YouTube]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzNVQQhOpX8">at times</a>. I also tend to be pretty easy to read: folks can often detect my emotions on my face or in my voice. Admittedly, at the end of a long day, I can get a little exasperated at times. Organizers aren't the reason for the event, though – the attendees are. The Andy's, I feel, struck a good balance here.</p>

            <h3>how to talk about things going wrong</h3>
            <p>Which leads me to – perhaps – the biggest thing I hope to emulate about the organizers of XOXO: the humility. Whenever you’re running an event for folks that aren’t you, things can go a little haywire. While I had a pretty thoroughly positive experience at the event, I could tell that food lines, concerns over isolated incidents of attendee behavior, and some other conversations were really weighing on the Andys. 2,200-some attendees can be really difficult to manage, especially when one is used to having more control over the size and scope of the event. </p>

            <p>I respected how they reacted to the feedback they were receiving: with open ears, ready to help. I can’t speak to how the folks sending that feedback felt, but as an event host, I want to emulate that same degree of openness. Again, this feels like something that takes preparation and mindfulness, and can’t be done on-the-spot.</p>

            <p>There are a bunch of other thoughts I have about XOXO, but they have more to do with the (awesome) content of the event, the (magnificent) people I interacted with, and the (neat anti-burnout) things I came away with as an individual. For whatever reason, the frame of an event organizer was the most cohesive way I could find to organize my thoughts, but if you want to hear the others, let's talk!</p>
